By default, all update checking->downloading->installation cycle is performed automatically by the plugins native side. No additional code on the web side is required. However, those processes can be controlled through the corresponding JavaScript module.

It allows you to:
- subscribe for update related events;
- download new releases from the server;
- check, if update is cached and can be installed;
- install loaded updates;
- change plugin preferences;
- request user to download new version of the app from the store.
