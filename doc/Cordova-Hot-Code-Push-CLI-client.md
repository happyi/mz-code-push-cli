[Cordova Hot Code Push CLI client](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push-cli) is a command line utility that will help you with development and deployment of your web project.

With it you can:
- generate both `chcp.json` and `chcp.manifest` files, so you wouldn't have to do it manually;
- run local server in order to detect any changes you make in your web project and instantly upload them on the devices;
- deploy your web project on the external server.

Of course, you can use Hot Code Push plugin without that utility. But it will make it much easier.
